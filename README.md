# London-Fire-Brigade-Incidents-Report-Time-Series-Analysis---Power-BI-Dashboard

his repository contains the project files for a time series analysis of London Fire Brigade (LFB) incidents conducted using Power BI. The analysis spans incidents from 2020 to 2023 and provides actionable insights to enhance emergency services, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.

Introduction
The London Fire Brigade (LFB) is a major fire and rescue service in Greater London, England. This project utilizes Power BI to analyze LFB's incident data to uncover patterns and forecast future trends. The insights aim to support data-driven decision-making for better emergency response and resource management.

Objectives
The analysis aims to address the following:

Incident Group Analysis: Examine the frequency and trends of Fire, False Alarm, and Special Service incidents.
Hourly Analysis: Identify peak hours for incident occurrences.
Borough-wise Analysis: Highlight London boroughs with the highest incident reports.
Special Services Analysis: Explore the most common special services provided.
Forecasting: Predict future incident trends to assist planning and preparedness.
Data Source
The data for this analysis was obtained from the London Data Store, an open-access repository. It includes details on incident types, times, boroughs, and special services attended by LFB.

Methodology
The project followed these steps:

Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured the data in Power BI, separating key columns like Incident Group, Year, and Hour of Call.
Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards with line charts, bar charts, and stacked bar charts.
Forecasting: Applied time series analysis techniques like ARIMA/SARIMA to predict incident counts for 2024.
